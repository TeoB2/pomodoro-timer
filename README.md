# Pomodoro timer
Software for a Pomodoro Timer.

The Pomodoro Timer is a tool used to apply the Pomodoro Technique, which divides work into customizable intervals, typically 25 minutes, followed by short breaks. In this software, you can adjust the length of both work intervals and breaks, tailoring the duration to your needs, instead of following only the standard times. This helps improve focus and time management in a flexible way.
